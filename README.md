# SBI-Tutorial
Material for the AIMS AI for Science summer school tutorial on neural simulation based inference.


#### Intended Learning Outcomes
At the end of the session, students will be able to:

1. Define what neural density estimation is.
2. The case for simulation based inference or likelihood free inference.
3. 
3. Train a conditional normalizing flow based on affine coupling layers in Pytorch.
5. Understand how conditional normalizing flows can be leveraged to perform Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE).
6. Apply NPE to neuromuscular research.
