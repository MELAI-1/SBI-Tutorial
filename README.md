# SBI-Tutorial
Material for the AIMS AI for Science summer school tutorial on neural simulation based inference.

At the end of the session, students will be able to:

1. __Define__ the core concept of simulation-based inference (SBI) and __distinguish__ implicit-likelihood models from classical likelihood-based approaches.
2. __Build__ a normalizing flow by composing affine coupling layers and permutation layers, visualize its performance on the “two moons” problem, and __compare__ it to naive ABC in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
3. __Use__ the sbi Python library to approximate posteriors in a neuromuscular simulation problem, evaluating convergence and the impact of neural network hyperparameters.
